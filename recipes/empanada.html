    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An empanada is a type of baked or fried turnover consisting of pastry and filling, common in Spain, other Southern European countries, Latin American countries, and the Philippines. The name comes from the Spanish empanar, and translates as 'breaded', that is, wrapped or coated in bread.</p>

        <li>500g of minced meat</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon of garlic powder</li>

        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <h4>Bread</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the flour and salt with the lard in a bowl, and with your hands, integrate them to form crumbs</li>
        <li>Add the wine and enough warm water (approximately 3/4 cup) until you have a soft but not sticky dough</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes or until you have a smooth and elastic dough. Cover and let it rest while preparing the filling</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the filling: Heat the oil in a skillet, add the onion, and cook until it is transparent and well-cooked (it should not brown)</li>
        <li>Add the meat, Gourmet Garlic Powder, Gourmet Colored Chili Powder, Gourmet Whole Oregano, and Gourmet Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>cook until the meat is cooked through. Finally, add salt and Gourmet Ground Black Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Allow the mixture to cool</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To assemble the empanadas: Roll out the dough on a floured surface to approximately 1/2 cm thickness. Cut circles about 15 cm in diameter</li>
        <li>Then, fill each empanada with a spoonful of the meat filling, 2 raisins, an olive, and a piece of hard-boiled egg</li>
        <li>Moisten the edges of the dough with a little water, close and fold the edges, gently press to seal</li>
        <li>Brush the empanadas with beaten egg, place them on a lightly greased baking tray with oil or butter</li>
        <li>Poke them twice with a cocktail stick and bake in a preheated oven at 180ÂºC for about 40 minutes or until the dough is cooked and golden</li>
    </ol>
