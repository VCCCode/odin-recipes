        <li>500 gr of minced meat</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of cumin</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of coloured chili</li>

        <li>6 short chicken legs</li>
        <li>3 boiled eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of black olives</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Cake</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>10 to 12 cake corns</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of basil</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>More basil at will</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the cover</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet, add the chopped onion, and cook until it's transparent and soft. Add the ground meat and seasonings, cook until the meat is cooked through (the filling should be juicy). Add the raisins and set aside.</li>
        <li>For the corn layer, remove the kernels from the cob and then process them along with the dried basil until you have a paste. Heat the butter in a pot, add the corn paste, and cook for a couple of minutes. Add the milk and cook, stirring, until you have a thick mixture. Season with salt and chopped basil. Divide the filling into 6 individual (lightly buttered) baking dishes or in a large clay dish. Place 2 olives, half a hard-boiled egg, and a piece of chicken in each dish. Finally, cover with the corn paste. Sprinkle each pie with sugar.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190Â°C. Bake the corn pies for 30 to 35 minutes or until they are bubbling and the tops are golden brown.</li>
