    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mote con huesillo is a traditional Chilean summer-time drink often sold in street stands or vendor carts. It is a non-alcoholic beverage consisting of a sweet clear nectar-like liquid made with dried peaches (huesillo) cooked in sugar, water and cinnamon, and then once cooled, mixed with fresh cooked husked wheat berries (mote)</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dried peaches</li>
        <li>Sugar or honey</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Husked wheat</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Thoroughly wash the dried peaches (huesillos) and place them in a bowl with boiled water. Cover and let them soak overnight. The next day, transfer the soaked dried peaches along with the soaking water, whole gourmet cinnamon, sugar, and chancaca (an unrefined sugar) to a pot. Cook over medium heat until the dried peaches are tender; they should be soft when pierced, approximately 35 to 40 minutes. Cool and then refrigerate until well-chilled.</li>
        <li>In another pot, cook the husked wheat (mote) in water for 3 to 4 minutes. Strain and cool the husked wheat under cold running water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>To serve, place husked wheat at the bottom of a tall glass. Add 3 to 4 dried peaches, then top with the juice from the soaked dried peaches. Serve immediately."</li>
